		<h1>LESSON 1: Internet and the World Wide Web</h1>
		
		<h3>What is the Internet?</h3>
	    
		<p>Internet is short for Internetwork it is the process of interconnecting a single network with other networks. Network is defined as the connection of devices together to communicate and share resources where the connection may either be wired or wireless. Internet is a global network of networks that use the Internet Protocol Suite to link the devices worldwide. Protocols are communication standards that devices will agree on. </p>
		
		<h3>History of the Internet</h3>
		
		<p>The Internet was brought online in 1969. From the root word "inter" which means outside boundery and "network" which interconnects devices to communicate and share data.</p> 

		<h3>The World Wide Web</h3>
	        <p>The world wide web allows documents to be connected to other documents by hypertext links. These documents are identified as Uniform Resource Locators or URLs and they are interlinked by hypertext links that can be accessed through the internet. World wide web is established in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee.</p>
		
	       <h3>WAIS(Wide Area Information Servers)</h3>
	       <p> WAIS is established before the world wide web. It is an internet system wherein specialized subject databases are created at multiple server locations. It is a client-server text searching system that is used to search index databases on remote computers.</p>
		
	       <h3>Gopher Protocol</h3>
	       <p>The Gopher is similar with WAIS but has hierarchies. Gopher protocol is composed of different hierarchies of information; it is designed for the search and retrieval of distributed document. </p>
	       <p> e.g. search engines (archie, veronica, ...) </p>
		
	       <h3>Usenet</h3>
	       <p>It is an online distributed discussion system available on computers.</p>
	       <p> e.g. online bulletinboards </p>
