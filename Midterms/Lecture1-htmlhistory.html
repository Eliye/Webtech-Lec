					<li> HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)
                <p>HTML has had a life-span of roughly seven years.
                During that time, it has evolved from a simple language with a small number of tags to a complex
                system of mark-up, enabling authors to create all-singing-and-dancing Web pages complete with 
                animated images, sound and all manner of gimmicks. This chapter tells you something about the Web's 
                early days, HTML, and about the people, companies and organizations who contributed to HTML+, HTML 2,
                HTML 3.2 and finally, HTML 4.</p>
