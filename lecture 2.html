	<h1>LESSON 2: Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</h1>
	<h3>HTTP</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>application layer communications protocol used to access resources (hypertext/hypermedia) on the World Wide Web.</li>
	<li>invented by Tim Berners-Lee</li>
	<li>jointly developed by the W3C and the IETF</li>
	<li>version history :<br />
	<ul>
	<li>HTTP 0.9 (1991)</li>
	<li>HTTP 1.0 (RFC 1945, May 1996) ;</li>
	<li>HTTP 1.1 (RFS 2068 Jan 1997, RFC 2116 Jun 1999), RFC 7230 - 7235 (Jun 2014) ;</li>
	<li>HTTP 2 (RFC 7540 May 2015) ;
	<ul>
	</ul>
	</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>HTTP Fundamentals</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>HTTP runs on top of TCP/IP, using TCP port 80 by default or TCP port 443 for HTPPS (over SSL/TLS)</li>
	<li>HTTP is based on a client - server architecture
	<ul>
	<li>Client, a.k.a. user agents (UA) : request resources from server.
		<li> Web Client : ex. web browsers such as Chrome, Edge, Firefox ..
			Web crawlers/spiders : ex. googlebot of Chrome
		<li> http Client : ex. applications in mobile
	<ul>
	<li>web browser, web crawlers/spider, other end user tools and applications</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Servers :
	<ul>
	<li>Origin Server - web resources are physically there. 
			  - a machine with application running through web.</li>
	<li>Proxy Servers (to authenticate), gateways, tunnels (blind relay)</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>HTTP uses a request-response standard protocol
	<ul>
	<li>the clients sends an HTTP request message to the server</li>
	<li>the server processes the request and replies with an HTTP response message
		* pull, polling (check server ; refreshing)</li>
	<li> STATELESS </li>
	<li> figures what clients want to do but soon forgets client (save and forget)
	<li> MIME </li>
	<li> Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions
		ex. (file/format) : txt/html , img/png
		
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>HTTP is a stateless communications protocol
	<ul>
	<li>Servers do not keep information about clients in-between request</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>HTTP provides support for other functionalities, such as :
	<ul>
	<li>cache control - general-header field is used to specify directives for caching mechanisms in both, requests and responses</li>
	<li>control media type (MIME) specification - two-part identifier for file formats and format contents transmitted on the Internet.
		The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) is the official authority for the standardization and publication of these 
		classifications</li>
	<li>language and character set specification - may appear at the beginning of the parameter value
				-Asterisks ("*") are reused to provide the indicator that language and
				   character set information is present and encoding is being used. A
				   single quote ("'") is used to delimit the character set and language
				   information at the beginning of the parameter value. Percent signs
				   ("%") are used as the encoding flag, which agrees with RFC 2047.</li>
	<li>content/transfer coding - used to indicate the type of transformation that has been used in order to represent the body in an 
		acceptable manner for transport.
				    - designed to specify an invertible mapping between the "native" representation of a type of data and a 
					representation that can be readily exchanged using 7 bit mail transport protocols, such as those 
					defined by RFC 821 (SMTP).</li>
	<li>content negotiation - the process of selecting the best representation for a given response when there are multiple representations 
				available.</li>
	<li>client protocol negotiations - selection of the best representation for a response is performed by the user agent after receiving an 
		initial response from the origin server.</li>
	<li>server protocol negotiations - the selection of the best representation for a response is made by an algorithm located at the server</li>
	<li>persistent connection - HTTP keep-alive, or HTTP connection reuse, is the idea of using a single TCP connection to send and receive 
		multiple HTTP requests/responses, as opposed to opening a new connection for every single request/response pair.</li>
	<li>request pipelining - is a technique in which multiple HTTP requests are sent on a single TCP connection without waiting for the 
		corresponding responses.</li>
	<li>authentication/authorization - the simplest technique for enforcing access controls to web resources because it doesn't require 
		cookies, session identifiers, or login pages; rather, HTTP Basic authentication uses standard fields in the HTTP header, 
		obviating the need for handshakes.</li>
	<li>etc.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	</ul>
