            <h1>Lecture 2: Node.js </h1>
<p> - a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, 
non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js' package ecosystem, npm, 
is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world. </p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<h3> API Reference Documentation </h3>
<p>provides detailed information about a function or object in Node.js. 
This documentation indicates what arguments a method accepts, the return
value of that method, and what errors may be related to that method. It also
indicates which methods are available for different versions of Node.js.</p>
</ul>

<ul>
<h3> History </h3>
<p> Node.js was originally written by Ryan Dahl in 2009, about thirteen years 
after the introduction of the first server-side JavaScript environment, Netscape's LiveWire Pro Web.
The initial release supported only Linux and Mac OSX. Its development and maintenance was led by Dahl and 
later sponsored by Joyent.</p>

<li>Overview</li>
<p> Node.js applications can run on Linux, macOS, Microsoft Windows, NonStop,
and Unix servers. They can alternatively be written with CoffeeScript
(a JavaScript alternative), Dart or Microsoft TypeScript (strongly typed forms of JavaScript),
or any other language that can compile to JavaScript.</p>

<li> Features of Node.js </li>
<ul>
<li>Asynchronous and Event Driven</li>
<p>All APIs of Node.js library are asynchronous, that is, non-blocking. It essentially means a
Node.js based server never waits for an API to return data. The server moves to the next API 
after calling it and a notification mechanism of Events of Node.js helps the server to get a 
response from the previous API call.</p>
<li>Very Fast</li>
<p></p>
<li>Very Fast</li>
<p>Being built on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine, Node.js library is very fast in 
code execution.</p>
<li>Single Threaded but Highly Scalable</li>
<p>Node.js uses a single threaded model with event looping. Event mechanism helps the 
server to respond in a non-blocking way and makes the server highly scalable as opposed 
to traditional servers which create limited threads to handle requests. Node.js uses a
single threaded program and the same program can provide service to a much larger number
of requests than traditional servers like Apache HTTP Server.</p>
<li>No Buffering</li>
<p>Node.js applications never buffer any data. These applications simply output the data in chunks.</p>
</ul>
